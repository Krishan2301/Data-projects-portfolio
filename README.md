## 📁 Project 1: Smartphone Market Analysis (EDA)

**Goal:**  
Understand the smartphone market using specifications and pricing data.

**What We Did:**
- Cleaned messy text data (e.g., RAM, camera, battery)
- Engineered new features (5G, charging speed, display size, etc.)
- Visualized patterns across brands, price ranges, and specs

**Insights:**
- Most phones have **4–8 GB RAM**, **128 GB storage**, and **5000 mAh battery**
- **50–64 MP** is the common camera range
- **Mid-range phones** offer the best rating-to-price value
- **5G is common**, but **NFC and IR blaster** are rare

**Value Delivered:**
- Helps consumers & marketers understand how price aligns with specs
- Can guide product comparisons or targeted promotions

## 📁 Project 2: Insurance Claim Prediction (Logistic Regression)

**Goal:**  
Predict whether a person filed an insurance claim.

**What We Did:**
- Cleaned missing values and outliers
- Scaled numerical data
- Built a logistic regression model using a clean pipeline

**Model Performance:**
- Good prediction accuracy using basic features
- ROC AUC added to evaluate model's classification strength

**Insights:**
- Claim predictions are influenced by age, seatbelt use, and insurance status
- Most impactful preprocessing steps were scaling and median imputation

**Value Delivered:**
- Automates claim prediction
- Helps insurers flag cases for review or intervention
